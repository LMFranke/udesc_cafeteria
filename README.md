# Udesc Cafeteria

Project to UDESC

## About

This project is my first project on Flutter, I did it for a project for my higher education course.

## What did I used

For this project I used these dependencies:

-google_nav_bar;

-provider;

-drift;

-sqlite3_flutter_libs;

-path_provider;

-path;

-intl;

-shared_preferences;

## For what I used it

-The 'google_nav_bar' I used it to navigate between the menu screen and the requests screen;

-The 'provider', 'path', 'path_provider' I used it to update the screen whenever there was a change;

-The 'sqlite3_flutter_libs', 'drift' I used it to be the local database, I choose to only do it locally because it would save me a lot of time;

-The 'shared_preferences' I used it to save the user's configs;
